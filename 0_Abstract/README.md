## Distance Measurement

The report details the implementation of distance measurement system using the
ultrasonic waves. As the human earâ€™s audible perception range is 20 Hz to 20 kHz, it is
insensitive to ultrasonic waves, and hence the ultrasound waves can be used for applications in
industries/vehicles without hindering human activity. They are widely used as range meters and
proximity detectors in industries also it can be used in parking assistance system. The distance
can be measured using pulse echo and phase measurement method. Here the pulse echo method
is used. The measurement unit uses a continuous signal in the transmission frequency range of
ultrasonic transducers. The signal is transmitted by an ultrasonic transducer, reflected by an
obstacle and received by another transducer where the signal is detected. The time delay of the
transmitted and the received signal corresponds to the distance between the system and the obstacle.
