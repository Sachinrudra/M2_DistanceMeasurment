# M2_DistanceMeasurment







## Introduction

The ultrasonic sensor is a cheap sensor that can measure 2cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement functionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach up to 3mm. It uses sonar waves for echolocation, like bats, to be able to measure distances. This project is an introduction to the use of an ultrasonic sensor, since it is often not straightforward nor intuitive to wire and code.In this project, we have used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with Atmega328 to determine the distance of an obstacle from the sensor. The basic principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in the environment then waves return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on the obstacle. So we only need to calculate the traveling time of both sounds means outgoing time and returning time to origin after striking on the obstacle. As the speed of the sound is known to us, after some calculation we can calculate the distance.
